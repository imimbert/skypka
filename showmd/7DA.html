# 0x7DA
I am a junior high school student, proficient in Python, C++, and algorithms, and also interested in web development.
I believe that programming is a free creation, where I can build a world with code that is different from reality (just like playing Minecraft). Because I am a junior high school student, I had little programming time during the last semester. By the time I entered high school, my vacations would also become very short, making it difficult to complete a complete project. Most students in Shandong are like this.
I also enjoy researching hardware, such as assembling computers and microcontrollers.

I started learning programming in the fourth grade of elementary school and joined a technical exchange group called Developers Union during the winter vacation of 2023, where I met Sura. At that time, there were 5 people in the development team, and we worked together to create the website during that holiday. It was a happy time. Later, the group leader mdr left, and after the start of the school year, the remaining four people gradually had less communication, until the development team's group also disbanded in the end. Later, Sura and I worked on the project together, but we lost contact with the other two people. Recently, I contacted one of those two people and learned that they have also lost contact. Later, Sura and I founded Skypka. We don't expect anyone to join us, I just think it's a utopia without intense competition in reality (classmates want to surpass each other, they don't want to speak clearly, in reality, they don't want others to surpass them, there's no pure friendship). Here, we can escape from the various troubles of academic and social life, and gain pure happiness. Perhaps this educational model is not suitable for us to develop our hobbies
